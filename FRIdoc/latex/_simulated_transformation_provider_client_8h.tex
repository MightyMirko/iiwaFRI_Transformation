One can simulate a real sensor by setting a sampling rate for the sensor (i.\+e. when are transformations and corresponding timestamps updated) as well as providing the sampling rate by FRI (i.\+e. at what frequency is the client polled by the robot controller). \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
